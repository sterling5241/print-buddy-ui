# Print Buddy UI

The web interface for [Printer Buddy](https://github.com/sterling5241/printer-buddy): the dashboard, printer pages
and every panel. Printer Buddy's installer fetches it next to the main app (`print-buddy-ui/`), which serves it at
`/static/`. Set `PB_UI_DIR` to use a copy somewhere else.

## Layout

```
index.html      main page
share.html      public share-link page
assets/         icons
core/           layout builder, panel registry, page-wide extras
panels/         one folder per panel (print, control, machine, camera)
styles/         builder.css
vendor/         echarts, echarts-gl, three.js
```
Each folder has a README.txt saying what's in it.
